        <p contenteditable="true">
          The modern English word

            ><a href="music.html" ping="origin">music</a></span

          came into use in the
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">1630s</span>. It descends
          from <span style="font-weight: 700">Middle English musike</span>,
          which in turn descends from Old French musique, then Latin mūsica—and
          ultimately from Ancient Greek mousiké technē (μουσική τέχνη), a phrase
          meaning "art of the Muses". The Muses were nine deities in Ancient
          Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences. They were
          included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,
          and eventually came to be associated with music specifically. Over
          time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the
          other muses. The Latin word musica was also the originator for both
          the Spanish música and French musique via spelling and linguistic
          adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords,
          including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian
          musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.

            It is often debated to what extent the origins of music will ever be

          scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the
          origin of language, and there is disagreement surrounding whether
          music developed before, after, or
